# Creator-Drones
A series of mods that convert the voice of the drone in 7 Days to Die to a number of content creators' voices.

My name is Genosis, and my wife and I run YouTube channels including Not-A-Gamer Gaming and my solo channel, Genosis. There we create content primarily for 7 Days to die, but also several other survival games as we become interested.

As a computer programmer by trade, I sometimes create tutorials (prefab editor) and modlets for various needs and projects. A question came up if it was possible to mod my wife's voice (DaphyDuck91 is the name she goes by in our channel) into the drone to keep me company. We laughed at the notion. 

Well, no one is laughing now. Well, actually they are because she's quite a character and the drone is a lot more fun with her in it. From there, I kept adding more content creators including myself. 

Currently the list of content creators that have voice packs are:

DaphyDuck91 - http://youtube.com/NotAGamerGaming
Genosis - http://youtube.com/Genosis
Capp00 - http://youtube.com/Capp00
Jawoodle - http://youtube.com/JaWoodle

More creators to come, as they become interested!

Enjoy the mods! I would like to combine all of these mods into a master mod that allows the player to select which creator they like. This could be done by having a drone entity specifically for each creator, or by creating a drone mod that lets you put voice discs in the drone in game to change the voice. This may happen if it's A) possible B) I figure out how or C) someone helps me do so.
